For example:\n\n- Double-booked two meetings at the same time?\n- Do you have an upcoming meeting without a location? \n- Have you been invited to a meeting that you haven't yet accepted? \n- Is an upcoming week unusually busy?\n- And more\n\nAutomatic travel time scheduling:\n\nWe're all stuck at home for now, but when we start venturing out into the world again, know that you'll never arrive late to where you need to be.\n\nMayday protects your time by automatically accounting for traveling to and from events. By analyzing the events in your calendar, Mayday determines which events require travel, and automatically blocks the necessary travel time in your schedule.\n\nMayday can also use your current location to automatically update travel-based calendar events in real-time. So even on the move, you'll always be on time.\n\nYour data, your privacy:\n\nWe recognize that your calendar data and location are sensitive, so we are taking data security and privacy very seriously.

      <p dir=false data-test-bidi>Time is our most valuable asset, but it&#39;s too easily lost, stolen, or misspent. Mayday&#39;s aims to fix that.<br /><br />As a smart calendar assistant, Mayday analyzes your schedule and helps you make time for what&#39;s most important in your life. It learns your habits &amp; routines, and acts as a companion to your existing calendar, making it smarter and more helpful.<br /><br />This release currently supports Google Calendar accounts, but additional integrations are coming soon.<br /><br />— Features —<br /><br />&quot;Spotlight&quot;<br /><br />Spotlight analyzes your calendar for potential issues that need your attention, and provides actionable ways to quickly resolve them. For example:<br /><br />- Double-booked two meetings at the same time?<br />- Do you have an upcoming meeting without a location? <br />- Have you been invited to a meeting that you haven&#39;t yet accepted? <br />- Is an upcoming week unusually busy?<br />- And more<br /><br />Automatic travel time scheduling:<br /><br />We&#39;re all stuck at home for now, but when we start venturing out into the world again, know that you&#39;ll never arrive late to where you need to be.<br /><br />Mayday protects your time by automatically accounting for traveling to and from events. By analyzing the events in your calendar, Mayday determines which events require travel, and automatically blocks the necessary travel time in your schedule.<br /><br />Mayday can also use your current location to automatically update travel-based calendar events in real-time. So even on the move, you&#39;ll always be on time.<br /><br />Your data, your privacy:<br /><br />We recognize that your calendar data and location are sensitive, so we are taking data security and privacy very seriously. We have no intention to resell your data in any way, now or in the future. For more details, check out our Privacy Policy (https://mayday.am/privacy-policy)</p>
